# Wargamer

## About
Wargamer is a Streamlit based app designed to provide a "servicable" opponent 
in a solitaire wargame. The primary aim of the app is to allow a player to 
fully control one faction in a game, while removing as much decision making as 
possible for the actions of the opposing faction. Doing so means the human 
player faces an army whose actions cannot be fully influenced by the conscious 
or subconcious thoughts and plans of the human player, resulting in a
significantly more satisfying solitaire experience.
